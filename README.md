Flatiron Movie Ticket System

Flatdango application allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the theatre.

Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Json server 

As a user, one can:
See the first movie's details, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets when the page loads. The number of available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of tickets_sold from the theater's capacity.
View the menu of all available movies on the left side of the page.
Buy tickets for a selected movie, with real-time updates to available ticket counts.
Upon loading the page, the details of the first movie are displayed, including its poster, title, runtime, showtime, and available tickets (derived from theater capacity minus tickets sold).
Select Movie: All available movies are listed in the left sidebar. You can click on any movie title to view its details instantly.
Buy Tickets: Each movie details section includes a "Buy Ticket" button. Clicking this button decrements the available tickets count if tickets are available. You cannot buy a ticket if the showing is sold out (0 tickets available).
